# Model Predictive Control (MPC) Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) to steer a car around a track in a simulator. The simulator provides a feed of values containing the position of the car, its speed and heading direction. Additionally it provides the coordinates of waypoints along a reference trajectory that the car is to follow. All coordinates are provided in a global coordinate system.

## Vehicle Model

A Kinematic model (ignores tire forces, gravity, mass, etc) is used for the Controller.

Position (x,y), heading (ψ) and velocity (v) form the vehicle state vector.

State: [x,y,ψ,v]

There are two actuators. Stearing angle (δ) is the first one, it should be in range [-25,25] deg. For simplicity the throttle and brake represented as a singular actuator (a), with negative values signifying braking and positive values signifying acceleration. It should be in range [-1,1].

Actuators: [δ,a]

The kinematic model can predict the state on the next time step by taking into account the current state and actuators as follows:

```
 x[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt

 yt+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt

 psi[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt

 v[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt
```

 where Lf measures the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity.

 Errors: cross track error (cte) and ψ error (eψ) were used to build the cost function for the MPC. They could be updated on a new time step using the following equations

 ```
 cte[t+1] = f(x[t]) - y[t] + v[t] * sin(epsi[t]) * dt

 epsi[t+1] = psi[t] - psides[t] + v[t] * delta[t] / Lf * dt
 ```
 ## MPC

 MPC algorithm uses an optimzer to find the control inputs and minimize the cost function.

 Data about waypoints was transformed into the vehicle space and a 3d order polynomial was fitted to the data. Actual state of the vehicle was "shifted" into the future by 100 ms latency. It helps to reduce negative effects of the latency and increase stability of the controller. The latency was introduced to simulate real delay of a human driver or physical actuators in case of a self driving car.

 Final duration of the trajectory is set to 1 second after several experiments. N (timestep length) is set to 10 and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) is set to 0.1.

 Some of the previous values I tried for N and dt are (20,0.05), (25,0.05) etc. If we use a larger N, number of variables in optimizer will also increase and will be major driver of computational cost.

 Larger values of dt will result in less frequent actuations, which makes it harder to accurately approximate a continuous reference trajectory. This is sometimes called "discretization error".

 Also in case of driving a car, prediction horizon should be a few seconds, at most. Beyond that horizon, the environment will change enough that it won't make sense to predict any further into the future.

* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
